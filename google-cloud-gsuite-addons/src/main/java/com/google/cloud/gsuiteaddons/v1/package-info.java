 * <p>======================= GSuiteAddOnsClient =======================
 *
 * <p>Service Description: A service for managing Google Workspace Add-ons deployments.
 *
 * <p>A Google Workspace Add-on is a third-party embedded component that can be installed in Google
 * Workspace Applications like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, and the Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides
 * editors. Google Workspace Add-ons can display UI cards, receive contextual information from the
 * host application, and perform actions in the host application (See:
 * https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/overview for more information).
 *
 * <p>A Google Workspace Add-on deployment resource specifies metadata about the add-on, including a
 * specification of the entry points in the host application that trigger add-on executions (see:
 * https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/concepts/gsuite-manifests). Add-on deployments
 * defined via the Google Workspace Add-ons API define their entrypoints using HTTPS URLs (See:
 * https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/guides/alternate-runtimes),
 *
 * <p>A Google Workspace Add-on deployment can be installed in developer mode, which allows an
 * add-on developer to test the experience an end-user would see when installing and running the
 * add-on in their G Suite applications. When running in developer mode, more detailed error
 * messages are exposed in the add-on UI to aid in debugging.
 *
 * <p>A Google Workspace Add-on deployment can be published to Google Workspace Marketplace, which
 * allows other Google Workspace users to discover and install the add-on. See:
 * https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/how-tos/publish-add-on-overview for details.
 *
 * <p>Sample for GSuiteAddOnsClient:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (GSuiteAddOnsClient gSuiteAddOnsClient = GSuiteAddOnsClient.create()) {
 *   AuthorizationName name = AuthorizationName.of("[PROJECT]");
 *   Authorization response = gSuiteAddOnsClient.getAuthorization(name);
 * }
 * }</pre>
